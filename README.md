# IPL-Score-Prediction

### **Project Overview:**
This project aims to predict the final score of the first innings in Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches using machine learning algorithms. Predicting the score accurately can provide insights for teams, broadcasters, and fans, and can be used in various applications such as strategic planning, fantasy sports, and sports analytics.

### **Objectives:**
- To develop a model that can predict the first innings score in an IPL match based on historical data.
- To experiment with multiple regression algorithms to determine the most accurate predictor.
- To analyze the performance of the models and understand the factors that contribute most to the prediction accuracy.

### **Data:**
The dataset used in this project includes historical IPL match data with features such as:
- **Batting team**
- **Bowling team**
- **Overs completed**
- **Runs scored**
- **Wickets taken**
- **Performance in the last 5 overs**
- **Date and year of the match**

### **Methodology:**
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The data is split into training and testing sets based on the year, with the training set including matches up to 2016 and the test set including matches from 2017 onward.
   - Irrelevant features, such as the date, are removed to focus on predictive features.

2. **Model Building:**
   - The following machine learning algorithms are explored:
     - **Linear Regression**
     - **Decision Tree Regression**
     - **Random Forest Regression**
     - **Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) Algorithm**
   - These models are trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data to predict the first innings score.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - The performance of each model is assessed based on the accuracy of the predicted score ranges.
   - Predictions are made for specific matches, and the predicted scores are compared against the actual scores to understand the modelâ€™s accuracy.

### **Challenges:**
- Cricket matches, especially in T20 formats like the IPL, are highly dynamic and unpredictable, making score prediction a complex task.
- The model needs to account for various factors such as team performance, match conditions, and in-game events that can significantly impact the final score.

### **Conclusion:**
The project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms in sports analytics, specifically in predicting the first innings score in IPL matches. Although predicting the exact score is challenging due to the unpredictable nature of cricket, the model provides a valuable tool for estimating score ranges based on historical data.

### **Potential Applications:**
- **Strategic Planning:** Teams can use the predictions for planning batting strategies.
- **Broadcasting:** Broadcasters can enhance viewer experience by providing score predictions.
- **Fantasy Sports:** Enhances the gaming experience by providing score predictions for users.
